# series from the hourly precipitation database (similar to the last example)

# (from the last example); alternatively it will set the metadata

processor.download(bbox, start, end, output, datasets = ['precip3240'])

# aggregate the data -- it's important to keep in mind missing data at many
# of these stations and the high degree of spatial variability associated with
# precipitation. in this example, all the data are aggregating into one series;
# however, it may make sense to aggregate more specifically to capture this
# variability to some degree (lots of papers on this subject).

precip = processor.aggregate('precip3240', 'precip', start, end)

# now these time series can be saved for later consistent with the structure
# used by PyHSPF's HSPFModel class (start date, time step in minutes, data)
# this way the data are easy to access later

ts = start, 60, precip

# dump it in a pickled file to use later

# (just look at a few months to highlight the concept)

# make a time series -- note that the solar radiation data are hourly

# let's use the processor to aggregate the NSRDB data together for the
# different data sources in the NSRDB
